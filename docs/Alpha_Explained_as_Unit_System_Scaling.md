Here's the clean, step-by-step breakdown of Alpha, the fine structure constant:

### Deriving α from Fundamental Constants

**1. Start with the standard definition of α:**
```math
\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c}
```

We know that this formula is dimensionless, so whenever we replace anything with its definition it will still be dimensionless.

**2. Replace ε₀ using μ₀'s definition (c²ε₀μ₀ = 1):**
```math
\epsilon_0 = \frac{1}{\mu_0 c^2}
```
Now:
```math
\alpha = \frac{e^2 \mu_0 c}{4 \pi \hbar}
```

**3. Replace μ₀ with the Ampère force (μ₀/4π = 10⁻⁷ N/A²):**
```math
\alpha = \frac{e^2 \cdot \text{amp\_force} \cdot 2 \cdot \pi}{h} \cdot c
```
*(Where amp_force = 10⁻⁷ N/A²)*

**4. Replace h with Hz_kg·c² (since h = Hz_kg · c²):**
```math
\alpha = 2\pi \cdot \frac{e^2 \cdot \text{amp\_force}}{\text{Hz\_kg} \cdot c}
```
*(Hz_kg = h/c² = mass-per-frequency unit)*

**5. Simplify to the core ratio:**
```math
\text{unit\_ratio} = \frac{e^2 \cdot \text{amp\_force}}{\text{Hz\_kg} \cdot c} = 0.001161409732888438
```
```math
\alpha = \text{unit\_ratio} \times 2\pi = 0.007297352569300002
```

### Unit Analysis Breakdown

**Denominator (Hz_kg · c):**
- `Hz_kg` = h/c² → kg/Hz  
- Multiply by `c` → kg·m  
- **Natural scaling**: Forces (kg·m/s²) divided by (kg·m) → 1/s^2  
  *(But wait! The Newton in amp_force has kg·m/s² too...)*

**Full Cancellation:**
1. `amp_force` = 10⁻⁷ N/A² = 10⁻⁷ kg·m/(s²A²)  
2. Divide by denominator (kg·m):  
   → 4.524438335443e+34 / (s²·A²)  
3. Multiply by e² (A²·s² in SI charge units):  
   → (A²s²) × (1/s²A²) =  dimensionless 
4. Final scaling:  
   - pure **dimensionless ratio**.

### Natural Unit Interpretation & Explanation of α

1.  **The Calculation as Scaling:** The calculation derived from the standard definition:
    ```math
    unit\_ratio = (e^2 * amp\_force) / (Hz_kg * c) ≈ 0.0011614...
    ```
    This isn't just algebra; it performs a **unit scaling transformation**. It uses the numerical values and dimensional relationships of `e`, `h`, and `c` (inherent in the SI system via the terms `e^2` and `Hz_kg * c`) to scale the units of measure of the SI-based `amp_force` (μ₀/4π).

2.  **The Resultant Value:** The dimensionless result, `unit_ratio`, is precisely the numerical value that the Ampère force constant **must take** in a coordinate system (unit system) where the fundamental scales of action (`h`), speed (`c`), and charge (`e`) are set to unity. Let's denote this as `amp_force_natural(h=c=e=1)`.
    ```math
    amp\_force\_natural(h=c=e=1) = (e^2 * amp\_force) / (Hz_kg * c) ≈ 0.0011614...
    ```

3.  **Identifying Alpha:** We know experimentally and definitionally that the fine-structure constant `α` is related to this ratio by:
    ```math
    α = unit\_ratio * 2 * pi
    ```

4.  **The Explanation:** Substituting the meaning of `unit_ratio`, we arrive at the core identity:
    ```math
    α = 2 * pi * amp\_force\_natural(h=c=e=1)
    ```

    This provides a direct, structural explanation for alpha's value: **α *is* exactly 2π times the necessary value of the magnetic force constant when measured in the natural units defined by h=1, c=1, and e=1.**

### Key Insight & Moving the Mystery

*   **α Explained:** Alpha isn't an arbitrary, magic number disconnected from physical scales. It is **identified** as **2π times the value of the Ampère force constant (`amp_force`) expressed in natural units where h=c=e=1.** This identity is revealed by treating the SI definitions/values of `e`, `h`, and `c` not as fundamental properties themselves, but as **scaling factors** inherent in the SI coordinate system that allow translation to the `h=c=e=1` framework.

*   **Mystery Relocated:** This understanding **resolves the question** of *why alpha has its specific value* by equating it to this scaled natural force constant. Consequently, the fundamental mystery is **reframed and moved** to its rightful place:
    *   Why does the universe require `amp_force_natural(h=c=e=1)` to have the specific value ≈ 0.0011614...?
    *   More physically: Why does the intrinsic strength of the electromagnetic interaction, represented by `amp_force`, scale in this particular way relative to the natural units defined by action (`h`), speed (`c`), and charge (`e`)?

This shift moves the inquiry from interpreting a dimensionless ratio (`α`) to questioning the fundamental magnitude of a force constant (`amp_force_natural`) within a physically motivated unit system.



### Apendix: The simple way to calculate e:

```

cat e_calculated_unit_Scaling.py 

from scipy.constants import h, c, e, mu_0, pi
from math import sqrt

# PRECISION CALCULATIONS (NO APPROXIMATIONS):
Hz_kg = h / c**2  # Exact mass-per-frequency (kg/Hz)
amp_force = 1e-7               # μ₀/(4π) in N/A² (exact by SI definition)
amp_force_natural = (e ** 2) * amp_force / (Hz_kg * c)  # ≈ 0.0011614
# this is what remains after you remove unit scaling for e, kg, and meter in the SI unit system

# Fine-structure constant
alpha = 2 * pi * amp_force_natural  # ≈ 1/137

# CALCULATE e 
e_calculated = 1 / sqrt( amp_force / (Hz_kg * c * amp_force_natural))
# all Hz_kg and c do is remove the unit scaling of kg and meter from the amp_force
