Here's the clean, step-by-step breakdown of Alpha, the fine structure constant:

### Deriving α from Fundamental Constants

**1. Start with the standard definition of α:**
```math
\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c}
```

We know that this formula is dimensionless, so whenever we replace anything with its definition it will still be dimensionless.

**2. Replace ε₀ using μ₀'s definition (c²ε₀μ₀ = 1):**
```math
\epsilon_0 = \frac{1}{\mu_0 c^2}
```
Now:
```math
\alpha = \frac{e^2 \mu_0 c}{4 \pi \hbar}
```

**3. Replace μ₀ with the Ampère force (μ₀/4π = 10⁻⁷ N/A²):**
```math
\alpha = \frac{e^2 \cdot \text{amp\_force} \cdot 2}{h} \cdot c
```
*(Where amp_force = 10⁻⁷ N/A²)*

**4. Replace h with Hz_kg·c² (since h = Hz_kg · c²):**
```math
\alpha = 2\pi \cdot \frac{e^2 \cdot \text{amp\_force}}{\text{Hz\_kg} \cdot c}
```
*(Hz_kg = h/c² = mass-per-frequency unit)*

**5. Simplify to the core ratio:**
```math
\text{unit\_ratio} = \frac{e^2 \cdot \text{amp\_force}}{\text{Hz\_kg} \cdot c} = 0.001161409732888438
```
```math
\alpha = \text{unit\_ratio} \times 2\pi = 0.007297352569300002
```

### Unit Analysis Breakdown

**Denominator (Hz_kg · c):**
- `Hz_kg` = h/c² → kg/Hz  
- Multiply by `c` → kg·m  
- **Natural scaling**: Forces (kg·m/s²) divided by (kg·m) → 1/s^2  
  *(But wait! The Newton in amp_force has kg·m/s² too...)*

**Full Cancellation:**
1. `amp_force` = 10⁻⁷ N/A² = 10⁻⁷ kg·m/(s²A²)  
2. Divide by denominator (kg·m/s):  
   → 10⁻⁷ / (s·A²)  
3. Multiply by e² (A²·s² in SI charge units):  
   → (A²s²) × (1/s²A²) =  dimensionless 
4. Final scaling:  
   - pure **dimensionless ratio**.

**Natural Unit Interpretation:**
- When `c = h = e = 1`, the ratio simplifies to:  
  ```math
  \text{amp\_force}_{\text{natural}} = 0.001161...
  ```
- `α` is just this value × 2π, exposing it as a **unit conversion factor**. 
- `α` is just the natural unit value of the amp_force scaled to natural units were c=h=e=1.

### Key Insight
α isn't magic—it's **the Ampère force's natural-unit value** scaled by 2π, revealed by stripping away SI's arbitrary conventions.
