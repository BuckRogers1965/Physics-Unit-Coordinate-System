** Deriving h_SI from classical KE formula.


1.  The standard Newtonian formula `KE_SI = ½ m_SI v_SI²` yields a result in Joules.
2.  This framework posits that:
    *   SI mass `m_SI` is related to a natural frequency `m_n_freq` via the scaler `Hz_kg_SI` (`m_SI = m_n_freq * Hz_kg_SI`).
    *   SI velocity `v_SI` is related to a dimensionless ratio `β` that is a fraction of the speed of light via the scaler `c_SI` (`v_SI = β * c_SI`).
3.  When these are substituted into the Newtonian formula:
    `KE_SI = ½ * (m_n_freq * Hz_kg_SI) * (β * c_SI)²`
    `KE_SI = (½ * m_n_freq * β²) * (Hz_kg_SI * c_SI²)`
4.  You define `h_SI = Hz_kg_SI * c_SI²`. where Hz_kg is the ratio between mass and frequency in the universe.
5.  Therefore, `KE_SI = (½ * m_n_freq * β²) * h_SI`.

**The Significance:**

*   **`h` as a Universal Energy Scaler:** This shows that the combination of SI scaling factors (`Hz_kg_SI * c_SI²`) required to convert a "natural" form of energy (here, `½ * m_n_freq * β²`, which is the formula expressed as a frequency) into SI Joules is precisely `h_SI`. This suggests `h` isn't just a "quantum" constant but the **fundamental SI scaling factor for energy when energy is conceptualized as originating from frequency-like natural quantities.**

*   **Implicit Structure:** Newtonian mechanics, by virtue of being dimensionally consistent and empirically correct (in its domain) for calculating energies in Joules using SI units for mass and velocity, *must* implicitly embody this `h_SI` scaling factor. The numerical values and units work out *because* this scaling is inherently part of the relationship between Joules, kilograms, meters, and seconds, as bridged by `Hz_kg_SI` and `c_SI`.

*   **Demystification and Unification:** This finding helps demystify `h`. If it's already "present" as the necessary energy scaler in classical Newtonian formulas (when viewed through your PUCS lens), its appearance in quantum formulas like `E=hf` becomes less about introducing a uniquely "quantum" entity and more about `h` playing its consistent role as the `Joule-per-Hertz` converter. This unifies its role across classical and quantum domains as *the* SI energy scaling factor when relating to frequency.

While this framework shows that h is "latently present" as the necessary overall energy scaler in Newtonian KE, that scales the natural ratios to J_SI energy scale, the specific value of Hz_kg (the m/f ratio) couldn't have been teased out from classical mechanics alone before h itself was quantified. Once h was quantified, however, then the relationship m/f = Hz_kg = h/c² becomes immediately apparent and definable.
