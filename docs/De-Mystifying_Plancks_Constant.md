# De-Mystifying Planck's Constant (h): A Unit Scaler, Just Like c²

## Abstract

Fundamental physical constants like the speed of light (c) and Planck's constant (h) are conventionally presented as mysterious, irreducible parameters defining the fabric of spacetime and the quantum realm. This paper argues that this interpretation is a fundamental misunderstanding. Drawing upon the perspective articulated by Einstein regarding E=mc², we propose that dimensionful constants are primarily unit scaling factors that quantify inherent, unit-independent proportionalities between equivalent physical quantities (such as mass, energy, frequency, temperature, length, and time) within arbitrary human-defined measurement systems. We demonstrate that the simple algebraic relationship h = (m/f)c² reveals h to be a composite scaling factor bridging frequency, mass, and energy, functioning exactly like c² bridges mass and energy. This simple truth has been obscured by the historical development of arbitrary unit systems, the misinterpretation of constants as drivers of physical phenomena rather than quantifiers of unit relationships, and a lack of conceptual frameworks explicitly modeling the layered nature of reality, perception, and measurement.

## 1. Introduction: The Iconic Equations and a Hidden Truth

The equations E = mc² and E = hf are cornerstones of modern physics. E=mc² reveals the equivalence of mass (m) and energy (E), mediated by the speed of light squared (c²). E=hf reveals the proportionality between energy (E) and frequency (f), mediated by Planck's constant (h).

Conventionally, these equations are presented as fundamental laws defining relationships between seemingly distinct physical properties, with c and h viewed as fundamental constants inherent to the universe's structure. However, this paper argues for a simpler, more profound interpretation: these constants are not mystical inputs from reality, but necessary scaling factors (or "exchange rates") that translate measurements between our arbitrarily scaled units (like kilograms, meters, seconds, Joules, Hertz) because the quantities they relate are, at a deeper level, different measures of the same underlying physical reality.

## 2. Einstein on E=mc²: c² as a Unit Scaling Factor

As articulated by Einstein himself regarding the equivalence of mass and energy:

> “If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c². … The mass of a body is a measure of its energy-content.”
> — *Albert Einstein, 1905, “Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?”*  
> [Annalen der Physik, 18:639–641]

**Modern meaning**: Energy and mass are directly proportional, with \( c^2 \) acting as the ratio between them. The numerical value of this ratio depends on the units used to measure energy and mass.


> “The inertia of a system necessarily depends on its energy-content, and this led straight to the notion that inert mass is simply latent energy.”
> — *Albert Einstein, 1919, “What is the Theory of Relativity?”*  
> [Originally published in The London Times, Nov 28, 1919]

**Modern meaning**: Mass and energy are two expressions of the same physical quantity. According to relativity, mass is energy that is "at rest," and their equivalence is a necessary consequence of the theory.


> “It is customary to express the energy E in the form E = mc², since c² is the energy equivalent of the unit of mass. It is clear from this that the energy that belongs to the mass m is equal to mc².”
> — *Albert Einstein, 1946, “E = mc²: The Most Urgent Problem of Our Time”*  
> [Science Illustrated, Vol. 1, No. 1]

**Modern meaning**: The equation \( E = mc^2 \) expresses a unit-based proportionality between mass and energy. The constant \( c^2 \) translates mass units into energy units; its size depends on how time and length are defined.

---

These quotes are of profoundly significant. Einstein explicitly states that energy and mass are directly proportional ath that its specific value would depend on the choice of unit scaling for length and time. This directly supports the view that c² is the numerical factor required to convert a quantity of the underlying "stuff" measured on the mass scale (in kilograms) to the same quantity measured on the energy scale (in Joules), because mass and energy are "essentially alike," merely different forms or measures of the same thing.

c² in E=mc² functions as a **unit scaling factor** bridging the arbitrary scales of the kilogram and the Joule according to the inherent, unit-independent proportionality between Mass and Energy that arises from the structure of spacetime.

## 3. Extending the Equivalence: E=hf and the Nature of h

The relationship E=hf reveals a similar fundamental proportionality: Energy (E) is proportional to Frequency (f). Just as E=mc² tells us that Mass and Energy are equivalent measures of the same thing, E=hf tells us that Frequency and Energy are also equivalent measures of the same thing. The constant h acts as the necessary scaling factor to convert a quantity measured on the frequency scale (in Hertz) to the same quantity measured on the energy scale (in Joules).

Since both equations relate Energy to other quantities (Mass and Frequency), we can equate them:

mc² = hf

Rearranging this equation to isolate h, we get:

h = (m/f) c²

This algebraic identity, always present in the fundamental equations, holds the key to understanding the true nature of h. It shows that h is not an independent, fundamental constant in the same sense that a dimensionless coupling constant might be. Instead, h is a **composite scaling factor** derived from other, more fundamental scaling relationships within the chain of equivalences:

*   **(m/f)**: This term represents the scaling factor required to convert a quantity measured on the frequency scale (Hertz) to the same quantity measured on the mass scale (kilograms) because Mass and Frequency are inherently proportional (m ~ f). Let's call this the kg/Hz scaling factor (or its inverse).
*   **c²**: As established by Einstein, this is the scaling factor required to convert a quantity measured on the mass scale (kilograms) to the same quantity measured on the energy scale (Joules) because Mass and Energy are inherently proportional (m ~ E). This is the kg/Joule scaling factor.

Thus, the equation h = (m/f) c² can be understood as a statement about unit scaling:

(Frequency-to-Energy Scaling Factor) = (Frequency-to-Mass Scaling Factor) × (Mass-to-Energy Scaling Factor)

This means that the constant h, which scales Frequency measurements to Energy measurements in the SI system, is the direct result of combining the necessary scaling from Frequency to Mass with the necessary scaling from Mass to Energy. It simply represents the required numerical conversion to jump two steps in the chain of fundamental equivalences (f ~ m ~ E) using our chosen SI unit scales.

In a hypothetical "natural" unit system where Mass, Energy, and Frequency were all measured using the same fundamental unit (reflecting their inherent equivalence), the scaling factors between them would numerically be 1. In such a system, setting c=1 and h=1 would lead to the simple identity E=m=f, revealing the underlying unity directly, without the need for explicit scaling constants.

## 4. Why Was This Obscured?: The Veil of Arbitrary Units and Misinterpretation

If the true nature of h (and other constants like k_B, G, e) is this simple: they are unit scaling factors for inherent proportionalities, quantified by their numerical values relative to our arbitrary unit choices, why has this not been the standard, dominant understanding?

Several factors contribute to this obscuration:

*   **Arbitrary and Mismatched Unit Scales (Layer 3):** The historical development of SI units led to base units (meter, kilogram, second, Kelvin) whose scales are wildly disparate compared to the natural proportionalities of the universe. For example, the number of "natural length units" in a meter is vastly different from the number of "natural time units" in a second, leading to a large numerical value for c. Similarly, the scales of the Hertz, kilogram, and Joule are such that the required scaling factors h and (m/f) are tiny or huge numbers, making them seem mysterious and "fundamental" rather than simply large/small conversion rates.
*   **Misinterpretation of Constants as Drivers of Physics:** Instead of seeing constants as bridges between measurement units for equivalent quantities, the standard view often interprets them as fundamental parameters *defining* or *driving* physical phenomena. h is seen as defining the "size of quantum effects" or "quantizing action," rather than quantifying the relationship between wave properties (frequency, momentum) and particle properties (energy, mass) in SI units. G is seen as defining the "strength of gravity," rather than scaling mass/energy to spacetime curvature units.
*   **Dimensional Analysis Limitations:** While dimensional analysis confirms that constants have the correct units ([ML²T⁻¹] for h, [L²T⁻²] for c²) to make equations dimensionally consistent, it doesn't explicitly foreground that the *numerical value* of the constant quantifies the precise scaling needed *between the arbitrary numerical scales* assigned to those dimensions in a given unit system like SI, based on an underlying proportionality.
*   **The Language of Laws vs. The Language of Measurement:** Physics emphasizes describing the *laws* of nature (Layer 4). The role of constants is often framed within these laws. Less emphasis is placed on the *epistemology of measurement* itself (Layer 3) – how our arbitrary definitions of units necessitate these specific scaling factors to relate measurements of fundamentally proportional aspects of reality (Layer 1/2).
*   **The "Mystique" of Quantum Mechanics:** The revolutionary nature of quantum mechanics, and phenomena like quantization and the uncertainty principle, were often presented with an air of inherent "weirdness." Planck's constant h, being central to these phenomena, was imbued with this mystique, further solidifying its image as a mysterious fundamental quantum parameter rather than a potentially simple unit scaler.

This combination of factors created a conceptual veil, hiding the elegant simplicity that h is fundamentally a composite scaling factor, just like c².

## 5. Conclusion: The Clarity of Unit Scaling

The simple relationship h = (m/f)c² reveals a profound truth obscured by conventional physics: Planck's constant h is not a mysterious quantum constant but a composite unit scaling factor. It bridges the arbitrary scales of frequency, mass, and energy units within systems like SI because these quantities are inherently proportional aspects of the same underlying physical reality (f ~ m ~ E).

Building on Einstein's insight that c² is a "mere constant of proportionality which depends on the choice of units," we see that h serves the same function, simply extending the chain of equivalence from Mass-Energy to Frequency-Mass-Energy. The perceived complexity and "mystique" surrounding h (and other constants) stem from the arbitrary numerical ratios imposed by our human-defined unit scales (Layer 3 artifacts) and the misinterpretation of these scaling factors as fundamental properties of reality itself (Layer 1/4 dogma).

Understanding constants as unit scaling factors for inherent proportionalities offers a clearer, more unified view of physics, potentially simplifying complex formulas and revealing the underlying elegance of a universe whose fundamental quantities are not disparate entities linked by mysterious parameters, but equivalent measures of a single, unified reality, merely quantified differently by our chosen units. The simplicity was always there, hidden in plain sight within the basic algebra, awaiting a framework to articulate its true meaning.
