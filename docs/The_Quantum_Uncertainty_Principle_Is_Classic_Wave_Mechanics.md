# The Uncertainty Principle Is Classical Wave Mechanics in Disguise

The PUCS framework continues here by exploring how the numerical values of physical constants in the SI system reflect deeply embedded relationships between units. As in prior chapters, we focus on scalar relationships between quantities such as energy, mass, and frequency, treating constants as coordinate  transformations within the PUCS structure.

## Abstract

This document walks through the dimensional breakdown of the uncertainty principle and shows that its "quantum" form is simply a classical wave relationship written in awkward human-defined units. By examining the units involved and reframing Planck's constant `h` as a unit conversion factor, we show that quantum uncertainty is **not** fundamentally mysterious—it's a restatement of classical wave localization and spectral spread. The illusion of "quantum weirdness" arises from treating a unit-scaling bridge (like `h`) as if it introduces new physics. It doesn’t. It merely converts wave frequency to momentum in SI units.

## 1. The Classical Wave Uncertainty Principle

From wave mechanics, we know:

    Δx · Δν ≥ 1 / 4π

- `ν` is the spatial frequency (wavenumber).
- Localizing a wave in space (`Δx`) causes it to spread in frequency (`Δν`).
- This is a universal property of wave packets, not specific to quantum mechanics.

---

## 2. The Quantum Mechanical Form

Quantum physics rewrites the uncertainty principle as:

    Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ / 2

With momentum defined as:

    p = h · ν

Substituting `ν = p / h` shows how the quantum form emerges from the classical wave relation.

---

## 3. Substituting Frequency Back In

Start from:

    Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ / 2

Divide both sides by `h`:

    Δx · (Δp / h) ≥ (ℏ / 2) / h = 1 / 4π

Perform a unit check:

- `Δx` has units [L]
- `Δp` has units [M·L·T⁻¹]
- `h` has units [M·L²·T⁻¹]

Thus:

    Δp / h = [M·L·T⁻¹] / [M·L²·T⁻¹] = [L⁻¹]

which is spatial frequency. Therefore:

    Δx · (Δp / h) = [L] · [L⁻¹] = [1]

- Dimensionless
- Identical to classical wave uncertainty
- Shows that `h` is just a conversion factor, not a quantum constant

---

## 4. Alternate Derivation with Frequency Scaling

Using natural unit scaling factors:

    Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ / 2

Express `p` and `h` in terms of `Hz_kg` and `c`:

    p = Hz_kg * c * f
    h = Hz_kg * c^2

Substitute into the uncertainty expression:

    Δx · Δf ≥ c / 4π

Divide both sides by `c`:

    Δx · (Δf / c) ≥ 1 / 4π

Since `f / c` is spatial frequency:

    Δx · Δν_spatial ≥ 1 / 4π

QED: The same classical wave relation.

## Implications

1. **Planck's constant is a unit converter** between wave frequency and SI momentum.  
2. **The uncertainty principle is a universal wave phenomenon**, not a quantum mystery.  
3. **Physics education should teach wave uncertainty first**, then introduce `h` as a scaling factor.

---

## Natural Units Clarification
In a consistent natural-unit system where we set \( h = 1 \) while keeping \( 2\pi \) explicit:

1. **Reduced Planck Constant**:  
   \[
   \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{2\pi}
   \]
   
2. **Uncertainty Relations**:  
   \[
   \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \Delta x \Delta \nu \geq \frac{1}{4\pi}
   \]
   - With \( p \equiv \nu \) when \( h = 1 \), both forms become identical.

3. **Key Implications**:
   - The geometric factor \( 1/4\pi \) is preserved naturally.
   - \( \hbar \) is revealed as \( 1/(2\pi) \) in these units.
   - The quantum and classical uncertainty principles are the *same physical relation* when stripped of human unit conventions.
   - Confirms \( h \) (not \( \hbar \)) is the fundamental unit-conversion constant in SI.

This demonstrates conclusively that Planck's constant serves only to bridge our artificial units (kg, m, s) to nature's wave-based reality.

## Example: Classical Gaussian Wave Packet and Quantum-Mechanical Uncertainty

In this section, we explore the relationship between position uncertainty (\( \Delta x \)), momentum uncertainty (\( \Delta p \)), and the spatial frequency uncertainty (\( \Delta v \)) for a Gaussian wave packet. We will compute both the classical uncertainty product \( \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \) and verify it against the quantum mechanical result, ensuring the consistency of the results.

### Classical Gaussian Wave Packet

Consider a Gaussian wave packet in position space, which is described by the following expression:

\[
\psi(x) = e^{-\frac{x^2}{2 \sigma_x^2}}
\]

where \( \sigma_x \) is the standard deviation of the wave packet in position space, and \( \Delta x = \sigma_x \). 

We can compute the uncertainty in momentum space (\( \Delta p \)) using the Fourier transform of the position space wave packet. The uncertainty in spatial frequency \( \Delta v \) is related to \( \sigma_x \) by:

\[
\Delta v = \frac{1}{4\pi \sigma_x}
\]

From the quantum mechanical definition, the uncertainty in momentum is related to the spatial frequency uncertainty by:

\[
\Delta p = h \cdot \Delta v
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant in SI units (\( 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

We will now verify that the product of position uncertainty and momentum uncertainty matches the value of Planck's constant.

### Python Program to Calculate Uncertainty

Below is a Python script that calculates the uncertainties in position, spatial frequency, and momentum for a Gaussian wave packet and checks the relationship between the uncertainties.

```python
import numpy as np

# Planck constant in SI units
h = 6.62607015e-34  # J·s

# Assume a Gaussian wave packet in position
# Define position space
x = np.linspace(-1e-6, 1e-6, 10000)  # meters
sigma_x = 2e-7  # Standard deviation in x (m)

# Classical Gaussian shape
psi_x = np.exp(-x**2 / (2 * sigma_x**2))

# Δx is standard deviation
delta_x = sigma_x

# Spatial frequency spread Δv (1/m)
# From Fourier transform of Gaussian: Δv = 1 / (4πσ)
delta_v = 1 / (4 * np.pi * sigma_x)

# Momentum spread from spatial frequency
delta_p = h * delta_v  # kg·m/s

# Check uncertainty products
uncertainty_xv = delta_x * delta_v
uncertainty_xp = delta_x * delta_p

# Print results
print(f"Δx       = {delta_x:.6e} m")
print(f"Δv       = {delta_v:.6e} 1/m")
print(f"Δp       = {delta_p:.6e} kg·m/s")
print(f"Δx·Δv    = {uncertainty_xv:.6e}")
print(f"Δx·Δp    = {uncertainty_xp:.6e} J·s")
print(f"h        = {h:.6e} J·s")
print(f"Check: Δx·Δp ≈ h · Δx·Δv = {h * uncertainty_xv:.6e}")
```

## Results

When the script is run, it outputs the following:

```
Δx       = 2.000000e-07 m  
Δv       = 3.978874e+05 1/m  
Δp       = 2.636717e-28 kg·m/s  
Δx·Δv    = 7.957748e-02  
Δx·Δp    = 5.273433e-35 J·s  
h        = 6.626070e-34 J·s  
Check: Δx·Δp ≈ h · Δx·Δv = 5.273433e-35 J·s  
```

As expected, the product Δx · Δp matches Planck's constant h when multiplied by the uncertainty in spatial frequency, verifying the quantum mechanical relationship between the uncertainties.

This example demonstrates how the classical uncertainty product Δx · Δp for a Gaussian wave packet can be reconciled with the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle. The calculations confirm that the two approaches yield the same result, ensuring the consistency and correctness of the assumptions and relationships presented in the previous chapters.

## Conclusion

The uncertainty principle is a dimensionless, geometric property of wave mechanics, independent of `h`. The "quantum" form simply disguises a universal wave relationship under SI units. Quantum physics is just classical wave mechanics expressed in awkward units.
