# Demystifying the Rydberg Constant via Unit Scaling

## Overview  
In this paper, we explore the Rydberg constant `R∞` and demonstrate that its complex form in SI units arises from the way we define fundamental constants like the speed of light, Planck's constant, and the elementary charge. By examining the relationships between these constants, we show that the Rydberg constant simplifies to a natural form, ultimately revealing a deep connection between the fine-structure constant, electron mass, and a simple geometric scaling factor. Through this approach, we uncover how **unit scaling** and **dimensional analysis** offer a cleaner, more intuitive understanding of this fundamental quantity.

## Step 1: Starting Point - The SI Expression

The Rydberg constant in SI units is traditionally written as:

```
R∞ = (α^2 * m_e * c) / (4 * π * ħ)
```

Where:
- `e` is the elementary charge  
- `m_e` is the electron mass  
- `c` is the speed of light  

We can expand out the formula to:

```
R∞ = (e^4 * 2 * π^2 * m_e * (10^-7)^2) / (Hz_kg^3 * c^3)
```

-

Where
- `10^-7` comes from `μ₀ / 4π = 10^-7 N/A^2`, the Ampère force constant
- `h = Hz_kg * c^2`  

---

## Step 2: Replace `ε₀` Using the Identity

```
ε₀ = 1 / (μ₀ * c^2) → ε₀^2 = 1 / (μ₀^2 * c^4)
```

Substituting into the expression:

```
R∞ = (m_e * e^4 * μ₀^2 * c^4) / (8 * h^3 * c)
   = (m_e * e^4 * μ₀^2 * c^3) / (8 * h^3)
```

---

## Step 3: Replace `μ₀` Using the Ampère Force Constant

```
μ₀ / (4π) = 10^-7 → μ₀ = 4π * 10^-7
```

Therefore:

```
μ₀^2 = (4π)^2 * 10^-14 = 16π^2 * 10^-14
```

Substituting into the expression:

```
R∞ = (m_e * e^4 * 16π^2 * 10^-14 * c^3) / (8 * h^3)
   = (2π^2 * m_e * e^4 * c^3) / (h^3) * 10^-14
```

---

## Step 4: Express `h` as `h = Hz_kg * c^2`

Then:

```
h^3 = Hz_kg^3 * c^6
```

So:

```
R∞ = (2π^2 * m_e * e^4 * c^3) / (Hz_kg^3 * c^6) * 10^-14
   = (2π^2 * m_e * e^4) / (Hz_kg^3 * c^3) * 10^-14
```

---

## Step 5: Insert `amp_force = μ₀ / 4π = 10^-7`

Recognizing that the Ampère force constant can be expressed as:

```
amp_force = μ₀ / 4π = 10^-7
```

Substituting into the expression for `R∞`:

```
R∞ = 2π^2 * m_e * (e^2 * amp_force)^2 / (Hz_kg^3 * c^3)
   = 2π^2 * m_e * (e^2 * 10^-7)^2 / (Hz_kg^3 * c^3)
   = (2π^2 * m_e * e^4) / (Hz_kg^3 * c^3) * 10^-14
```

---

## Step 6: Recognize `α`'s Relation to Ampère Force

From previous derivations:

```
α = 2π * amp_force_natural = 2π * 0.0011614097323
```

Thus:

```
10^-7 = α / (2π)
```

Squaring both sides:

```
(10^-7)^2 = (α / 2π)^2 = α^2 / (4π^2)
```

This allows us to rewrite the expression for `R∞` in terms of `α^2`.

---

## Step 7: Plug In `α` into `R∞`

Substituting into the simplified `R∞`:

```
R∞ = 2π^2 * (α^2 / 4π^2) * m_e
   = (α^2 / 2) * m_e
```

---

## Final Form in Natural Units

Thus, in natural units where `h = c = e = 1`:

```
R∞ = (α^2 / 2) * m_e
```

This final equation highlights a deep geometric truth:

> The Rydberg constant is not mysterious; it emerges as the product of a **pure dimensionless interaction strength squared** and the **mass of the electron**, scaled by a simple geometric factor.

## Simplified Formula for the Rydberg Constant

Starting with the simplified expression for the Rydberg constant `R∞` in natural units:

```
R∞ = (α^2 / 2) * m_e * (kg_Hz / c)
```

### Unit Analysis

To ensure dimensional consistency:

1. `α^2` is dimensionless.
2. `m_e` has units of mass (`kg`).
3. `kg_Hz` has units of `Hz/kg`, which is `1 / (kg * s)` since `Hz = 1/s`.
4. `c` has units of `m/s`.

Therefore, the units of `R∞` are:

```
(kg) * (1 / (kg * s)) * (1 / (m/s)) = 1 / m
```

This confirms that the simplified expression for `R∞` has the correct units of inverse meters (`m^-1`).

## Conclusion

This derivation resolves the apparent complexity of `R∞` by showing that all the nested constants simply represent scaling artifacts of the SI unit system. When we transition to a natural unit system, the Rydberg constant becomes an elegantly simple expression of atomic geometry:

```
R∞ = (α^2 / 2) * m_e
```

The remaining mystery is not `R∞`, but **why** `α` and `m_e` take the specific values they do.
