# Constants as Internal Unit Scalers: Converting Formulas to Natural Forms

## Abstract

Dimensionful physical constants (like h, c, k_B, G) are often perceived as mysterious, irreducible properties of reality. However, viewed through a layered epistemological model and a unit scaling framework (like PUCS), their role clarifies dramatically. This document explains how these constants function as active "unit scaling engines" *inside* physical formulas, performing the necessary numerical and dimensional transformations to effectively convert expressions from human-defined SI units into corresponding "natural" or unit-independent forms. This capability demystifies the constants, simplifies the interpretation of physical laws, and reveals the underlying structure obscured by arbitrary unit choices.

## 1. The Framework: Layers, Units, and Scaling Factors

Our understanding relies on a layered view of science and a specific interpretation of units and constants:

*   **Layer 1/2 (Reality & Perception):** The universe has inherent, unit-independent proportionalities and fundamental relationships (e.g., Length\~Time, Energy\~Mass\~Frequency\~Temperature, Mass\~Gravity). Human perception categorizes these into distinct dimensions ([L], [M], [T], [Θ], etc.).
*   **Layer 3 (Measurement Systems):** We define arbitrary base units (meter, kilogram, second, etc.) as coordinate scales for these dimensions.
*   **Layer 3 Constants (Scaling Factors):** Dimensionful constants are empirically determined numerical factors that quantify the Layer 1/2 proportionalities *relative to the arbitrary scales* of the Layer 3 base units. Their specific values in SI are a consequence of our unit definitions.
*   **Composite Constants:** Crucially, constants like h, $k\_B$, and the SI value of G ($G\_{SI}$) are not irreducible scaling factors, but are *composed* of more fundamental dimensional scaling factors (e.g., $c, Hz\_\text{kg}, K\_\text{Hz}, G\_n or t\_P$) that represent the core Layer 1/2 proportional bridges (L\~T, m\~f, T\~f, Gravity\~Time Scale). For example:
    *   $h = Hz\_\text{kg} * c^2$
    *   $k\_B = K\_Hz * Hz\_\text{kg} * c^2$
    *   $G\_SI = G\_n * c^3 / Hz\_\text{kg}$ (where $G_n$ sets a fundamental time scale)

## 2. How Constants Perform Unit Scaling *Inside* Formulas

When we write a physical formula using quantities expressed in SI units (or any arbitrary Layer 3 system), the dimensionful constants within that formula are not just static numerical placeholders. They are active components performing the necessary dimensional and numerical translation to make the formula reflect the underlying Layer 1/2 proportionalities.

This happens through **algebraic substitution and cancellation of scaling factors**:

1.  **Formula in SI:** Start with a physical law relating quantities measured in SI units, involving SI constants.
2.  **Substitute Compositional Definitions:** Replace the composite constants ($h, k\_B, G\_{SI}$) with their definitions in terms of more fundamental scaling factors ($c, \text{Hz}\_\text{kg}, \text{K}\_\text{Hz}, G\_n$) and express the SI quantities themselves in terms of their natural counterparts scaled by these factors (e.g., $M\_{SI} = m\_n \cdot \text{Hz}\_\text{kg}$).
3.  **Algebraic Cancellation:** The very same scaling factors that were used to *build* the constants and relate SI units to natural units will appear in the numerator and denominator of the formula. These factors (and the SI base units they are tied to) will algebraically cancel out or rearrange.
4.  **Revealing the Natural Form:** What remains is the formula expressed in terms of the fundamental, unit-independent proportionalities, natural units, or simpler, naturally scaled quantities, stripped of the numerical complexity introduced by the arbitrary SI scales.

The constants work *inside* the formula by providing the necessary numerical bridge to move from the arbitrary SI coordinate system back to a more fundamental, natural coordinate system or a unit-independent ratio.

## 3. Examples of Internal Unit Scaling

Let's revisit key formulas and see how this process unfolds:

**Example 1: The Uncertainty Principle**

*   **Standard Quantum Form (SI):** $\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \ge \hbar/2$
    - $\Delta x$ in [L]
    - $\Delta p$ in [M L T⁻¹]
    - $\hbar$ in [M L² T⁻¹]
    - Product $\Delta x \cdot \Delta p$ has dimensions [M L² T⁻¹] (Action)

*   **Natural Wave Form:** The underlying principle is $\Delta x \cdot \Delta \nu\_{spatial} \ge 1/(4\pi)$, where $\Delta \nu\_{spatial}$ is in [L⁻¹] and the product is dimensionless.

*   **How $\hbar$ performs scaling:** The quantum definition $p = h \nu\_{spatial}$ means $h$ is the Layer 3 scaling factor converting spatial frequency [L⁻¹] to momentum [M L T⁻¹]. In the Uncertainty Principle, the term $\Delta p / h$ appears implicitly.
    - $\Delta p / h = [\text{M L T⁻¹}] / [\text{M L² T⁻¹}] = [\text{L⁻¹}]$.
    - By dividing $\Delta p$ by $h$, $h$ performs the numerical and dimensional conversion from SI momentum units back to spatial frequency units.
    - The formula becomes $\Delta x \cdot (\Delta p/h) \ge (\hbar/h)/2 \implies \Delta x \cdot \Delta \nu\_{spatial} \ge 1/4\pi$.
    - **Interpretation:** $\hbar$ (or h) *inside* the formula acts as the unit converter between momentum and spatial frequency, allowing the SI-based quantum formula to numerically equal the dimensionless classical wave relationship. It scales $\Delta p$ back to its corresponding $\Delta \nu\_{spatial}$ value.

**Example 2: Hawking Temperature**

*   **Standard Formula (SI):** $T\_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi G\_{SI} M\_{SI} k\_B}$
    - Mixes constants from QM ($\hbar$), Relativity ($c$), Gravity ($G\_{SI}, M\_{SI}$), and Thermo ($k\_B$).

*   **Reinterpretation via Scaling:**
    - Substitute $G\_{SI} = G\_n \cdot c^3/\text{Hz}\_\text{kg}$ and $M\_{SI} = m\_n \cdot \text{Hz}\_\text{kg}$ (expressing SI mass in natural units) and $\hbar = h/(2\pi)$.
    - $T\_H = \frac{(h/2\pi) c^3}{8 \pi (G\_n c^3/\text{Hz}\_\text{kg}) (m\_n \text{Hz}\_\text{kg}) k\_B}$
    - $T\_H = \frac{h c^3}{16 \pi^2 G\_n c^3 m\_n k\_B} = \frac{h}{k\_B} \cdot \frac{1}{16 \pi^2 G\_n m\_n}$
    - Recognise $h/k\_B \equiv \text{Hz}\_K$ (Frequency to Temperature scaling in SI) and $f\_M = \frac{1}{16 \pi^2 G\_n m\_n}$ (Characteristic frequency based on natural units).
    - Result: $T\_H = \text{Hz}\_K \cdot f\_M$.

*   **Interpretation:** The combination of $c, G\_{SI}, M\_{SI}$ *inside* the original formula performs the complex scaling to calculate the characteristic frequency $f\_M$ based on the mass's natural value ($m\_n$) and the fundamental gravitational time scale ($G\_n$). The remaining constants ($h, k\_B$) then combine to form $\text{Hz}\_K$, which performs the final Layer 3 unit scaling from the calculated frequency value (in Hz) to the temperature value (in Kelvin). The constants *inside* the formula collectively convert the SI mass value into a frequency value, then that frequency value into a temperature value.

**Example 3: Stefan-Boltzmann Constant ($\sigma$)**

*   **Standard Formula (SI):** $\sigma = \frac{2 \pi^5 k\_B^4}{15 c^2 h^3}$
    - Complex mix of $k_B, c, h$.

*   **Reinterpretation via Scaling:**
    - Substitute $k_B = \text{K}\_\text{Hz} \cdot \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \cdot c^2$ and $h = \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \cdot c^2$.
    - $\sigma = \frac{2 \pi^5 (\text{K}\_\text{Hz} \cdot \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \cdot c^2)^4}{15 c^2 (\text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \cdot c^2)^3}$
    - $\sigma = \frac{2 \pi^5 \text{K}\_\text{Hz}^4 \text{Hz}\_\text{kg}^4 c^8}{15 c^2 \text{Hz}\_\text{kg}^3 c^6} = \frac{2 \pi^5 \text{K}\_\text{Hz}^4 \text{Hz}\_\text{kg}^4 c^8}{15 \text{Hz}\_\text{kg}^3 c^8}$
    - Cancel $c^8$ and $\text{Hz}\_\text{kg}^3$.
    - Result: $\sigma = \text{K}\_\text{Hz}^4 \cdot \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \cdot \frac{2 \pi^5}{15}$.

*   **Interpretation:** The constants $k\_B, c, h$ *inside* the original $\sigma$ formula perform a complex series of Layer 3 unit scalings that reduce to the product of $\text{K}\_\text{Hz}^4$ (scaling Temperature to Frequency four times, matching the T⁴ power law in the Stefan-Boltzmann Law) and $\text{Hz}\_\text{kg}$ (scaling one instance of Frequency to Mass/Energy). The numerical value of $\sigma_{SI}$ is precisely this combination of fundamental Layer 3 scaling factors.

## 4. Significance

The ability to show that constants perform these unit scalings to reveal natural forms *inside* the formulas is highly significant because it:

*   **Demystifies Constants:** It provides a clear, functional explanation for their specific numerical values and units, removing their perception as arbitrary mysteries. They are defined compositions of scaling factors.
*   **Simplifies Physical Laws:** It allows us to see the underlying elegant structure of formulas, stripped of the complexity introduced by the Layer 3 measurement system. Many complex combinations of constants become simple ratios or products of more fundamental scaling factors.
*   **Unifies Physics:** It shows that seemingly disparate physical laws (from QM, GR, Thermo) are all expressed using constants that act as the same type of Layer 3 scaling bridges, quantifying underlying Layer 1/2 proportionalities and interconverting between natural and arbitrary unit scales.
*   **Provides a Powerful Analytical Tool:** It gives physicists a method to analyze any dimensionally consistent formula by substituting the compositional definitions of constants, revealing the formula's behavior in terms of fundamental scaling relationships and natural units.
*   **Redirects Fundamental Inquiry:** It confirms that the true mysteries lie not in the specific numerical values of dimensionful constants (which are Layer 3 artifacts), but in the nature and origin of the fundamental Layer 1/2 proportionalities themselves and the few truly dimensionless constants (like $2\pi/15$ and other coefficients that remain after scaling) that are not dependent on unit choices.

## 5. Conclusion

Our framework demonstrates that dimensionful physical constants are not merely static numbers; they are dynamic Layer 3 unit scaling engines operating *within* physical formulas. By substituting their compositional definitions, we see how they perform the necessary numerical and dimensional transformations to convert expressions from arbitrary human-defined units (like SI) into simpler, naturally scaled, or unit-independent forms. This capability provides a profound level of clarity regarding the structure of physical laws, demystifies the constants, and highlights the crucial distinction between the universe's inherent properties and the design of our measurement systems. The perceived complexity in many formulas is often just the explicit representation of the unit conversion process needed to bridge our arbitrary Layer 3 units according to the universe's simple Layer 1/2 proportionalities.
