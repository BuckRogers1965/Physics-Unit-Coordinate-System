# Reality, Perception, Measurement, Theory: A Layered Model of Science 

## Abstract

We propose a four-layer epistemological model that distinguishes inherent physical relationships from the numerical artifacts introduced by measurement systems, clarifying the conceptual role perception, of the role of physical constants and derived units.  Starting from an objective, unit-independent physical reality (Layer 1), we describe the subsequent layers built upon it: human perception and categorization (Layer 2), the development of measurement systems based on base units and primary dimensionful constants (Layer 3), and finally, the formulation of physical laws, theories, and derived concepts/units (Layer 4). This model highlights the crucial distinction between inherent reality and our human-centric descriptive tools. We argue that misunderstandings about the function of elements in intermediate layers, particularly misinterpreting the numerical values of dimensionful physical constants as fundamental Layer 1 properties rather than as scaling factors quantifying Layer 1/2 proportionalities relative to arbitrary Layer 3 base units, can impede progress in Layer 4. Frameworks like the Physics Unit Coordinate System (PUCS) are presented as examples that operate by clarifying the relationship between Layer 3 and the inherent structure of Layer 1, as filtered through Layer 2.

## 1. Introduction

The fundamental goal of science is to understand physical reality. However, our understanding is always mediated by our tools, senses, and conceptual frameworks.

This paper introduces a four-layered model to clarify the process by which we build our scientific description of the universe, moving from objective reality to abstract theories.

Understanding these layers helps distinguish between the properties of reality itself and the properties of our descriptive systems.

We will describe each layer and discuss their interdependencies and potential points of confusion. This clarification aims to reveal underlying simplicity and redirect fundamental questions towards Layer 1 proportionalities rather than Layer 3 numerical artifacts.

## 2. Layer 1: Physical Reality (The Territory)

Description: The objective, mind-independent universe as it fundamentally exists.

Properties: Possesses inherent structure, fundamental constituents, intrinsic properties, and unit-independent relationships.This includes fundamental, unitless proportionalities—such as the equivalence between energy and frequency or mass and energy—which may reflect deeper symmetries or unifications. (e.g., inherent proportionality between Length and Time, Energy and Mass, Energy and Frequency, Energy and Temperature). It may be described as a unified "stuff" where perceived properties scale together as the state of a particle changes.

Nature of Access: This layer is the ultimate target of scientific inquiry, but we do not have direct, unmediated access to it. Our knowledge is always inferential, based on interactions interpreted through subsequent layers.

Key Concept: This layer operates according to its own rules, independent of human observation or measurement systems.

## 3. Layer 2: Human Perception and Categorization

Description: The initial interface between human consciousness/biology and Layer 1. This involves sensory input and innate cognitive processes that actively filter, process, and structure our experience, building an internal model of reality.

Role: This is where the continuous, potentially unified reality of Layer 1 is segmented and categorized into distinct, perceivable properties and conceptual dimensions. This layer is fundamentally anthropocentric.

Examples: We perceive mass (resistance to acceleration), length (spatial extent), duration (temporal passage), heat (thermal state), color (spectral property), electromagnetic interaction, etc. These perceptions lead to the conceptual dimensions of [M], [L], [T], [Θ], [Q], etc. The abstract concept of "Energy" may emerge here from perceiving related phenomena like motion, heat, and light transfer.

Significance: The specific dimensions and properties we identify in physics are heavily influenced by this layer's filtering. These categories may not reflect fundamental divisions in Layer 1 but rather our specific biological and cognitive way of interacting with and processing information from it (akin to prisoners in Plato's Cave seeing only shadows).

## 4. Layer 3: Measurement Systems (Base Units and Primary Scaling Factors)

Description: The first layer of formal mathematical description, built upon the distinct categories perceived in Layer 2. This layer defines the tools for quantifying perceived properties.

Components:
*   **Base Units:** Human-defined, arbitrary scales assigned as fundamental references for the dimensions identified in Layer 2 (e.g., kilogram [M], meter [L], second [T], Kelvin [Θ], Coulomb [Q]). These units set the arbitrary numerical 'grid size' along each perceived axis. Examples like defining the second based on a specific count of Cs transitions demonstrate using a Layer 1 phenomenon (the oscillation) with a Layer 3 human convention (the chosen count).
*   **Primary Dimensionful Constants (c, h, k, e, N_A):** Discovered through observation, these constants are Layer 3 entities that quantify the numerical value of Layer 1/2 proportionalities/equivalences *relative to the arbitrary scales of the Layer 3 base units*. They function as necessary scaling factors to convert a numerical value measured using one base unit scale to the equivalent numerical value on another base unit scale (or combination of base units), reflecting the inherent proportionalities of Layer 1 as manifested in Layer 2's categories. (e.g., the numerical value of 'c' in m/s quantifies the Layer 1 L/T ratio using the meter and second scales; the numerical value of 'h' in J/Hz (or kg m²/s) quantifies the Layer 1 E/f ratio using the kg, m, s scales). Their specific numerical values are artifacts of Layer 3 base unit choices relative to Layer 1/2 ratios.

Role: This layer translates qualitative Layer 2 perceptions into quantitative data using defined base unit scales.

## 5. Layer 4: Physical Laws, Theories, and Derived Concepts/Units

Description: The highest layer of abstract mathematical and conceptual modeling, built upon the quantitative data obtained using Layer 3 base units.

Components:
*   **Derived Concepts:** Formation of composite physical ideas like Force, Energy (kinetic, potential, thermal, etc.), Momentum, Work, Power. These are conceptual combinations and relationships *defined within the theoretical framework* based on the more fundamental Layer 2/3 quantities. These often describe interactions between Layer 2 perceived properties.
*   **Derived Units (Newton [M L T⁻²], Joule [M L² T⁻²], Pascal [M L⁻¹ T⁻²], etc.):** These are compound unit labels created *within Layer 4* to provide shorthand for the units of derived concepts when calculated using Layer 3 base units according to Layer 4 rules. Anything with a compound unit is typically a Layer 4 construct representing a concept that doesn't exist as a direct Layer 3 base measurement.
*   **Physical Laws:** Mathematical equations describing consistent relationships between Layer 3 measured quantities and Layer 4 derived concepts (e.g., F=ma relating Force (L4) to Mass (L2/3) and acceleration (L2/3 derived from L2/3 length/time)). These laws utilize the numerical values of Layer 3 constants to maintain consistency across different Layer 3 base units when relating quantities or concepts.
*   **Theories:** Broader explanatory frameworks, predictive models, and deeper mathematical structures that unify laws, explain phenomena, and attempt to describe the underlying mechanisms of Layer 1 (e.g., General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Standard Model, Thermodynamics).

Role: This layer aims to predict, explain, and ultimately understand Layer 1, using the language and structures developed in Layers 2, 3, and Layer 4 concepts/units. The effectiveness of these models in Layer 4 is measured by their predictive power against Layer 3 observations.

## 6. Interplay, Confusion, and Clarification

Interplay: Information flows between layers (Layer 1 influences Layer 2 filtering; Layer 2 informs Layer 3 dimension choices; Layer 3 measurements provide data for Layer 4 laws; Layer 4 theories attempt to describe Layer 1). Layer 4 insights can also refine our understanding of the perceived distinctions in Layer 2 and the required measurements in Layer 3.

Potential for Confusion:
*   Mistaking the categories of Layer 2 for fundamental divisions of Layer 1. The dimensions we perceive are human constructs, not necessarily the universe's inherent structure.
*   Misinterpreting the numerical values of Layer 3 constants – viewing them as inherent Layer 1 properties rather than scaling factors quantifying Layer 1/2 proportionalities relative to arbitrary Layer 3 base units. This is a primary source of confusion, leading to searching for deep, fundamental explanations for numbers that are artifacts of Layer 3 choices.
*   Conflating Layer 4 derived concepts/units (like Energy or the Joule) with fundamental Layer 3 measurements/base units (like Mass or the kilogram). Layer 4 concepts are theoretical constructs built upon Layer 2/3 foundations, not direct Layer 3 measurements.
*   Conflating properties of the map (Layers 2, 3, 4) with properties of the territory (Layer 1). This includes over-applying Layer 4 theoretical constructs directly to describe the fundamental nature of Layer 1 (e.g., assuming Layer 1 *is* composed of "energy" because Layer 4 energy models are effective).

Benefits of Clarification: Explicitly understanding these layers helps distinguish between inherent reality and descriptive constructs, redirecting foundational questions toward unit-independent aspects (Layer 1 proportionalities) and revealing potential underlying simplicity in Layer 4 when Layer 3 is properly understood (e.g., recognizing constants as unit scalings).

## 6.5 The Holographic Principle: Modeling Perception or Reality?
The emergence of concepts like the holographic principle presents a point of connection and potential confusion within the four-layered model. While often interpreted as a statement about Layer 1 reality being fundamentally holographic, viewed through this framework, an alternative emerges: holographic theories may primarily be modeling the structure of the transformation or projection from Layer 1 to the reality accessible via Layer 2 perception and Layer 3 measurement. Like the prisoners in the Cave building theories about the shadows, if the casting mechanism is holographic, the theories about the shadows will reflect this, without necessarily meaning the objects casting them are themselves holograms. Holographic principles may describe the nature of our accessible universe (Layers 2/3 interface) and thus influence Layer 4 theories built upon it.

## 7. Frameworks for Clarification: The Role of PUCS

Given the potential for confusion within Layer 3 and its impact on Layer 4 theories, developing frameworks specifically designed to clarify the nature of measurement systems is crucial for accurate physical description. Dimensional analysis, for instance, operates across Layer 2 concepts and Layer 3 units to check consistency in physical equations, providing a basic level of insight into dimensional relationships.

However, the Physics Unit Coordinate System (PUCS) is a more comprehensive framework designed to explicitly analyze and clarify the fundamental structure of Layer 3 itself. PUCS posits that any system of base units (like SI: kg, m, s, K, C) effectively defines a specific coordinate system or basis vectors within the abstract dimensional space identified by Layer 2 perceptions. Physical quantities are then simply points within this coordinate system, quantified relative to the chosen base unit scales.

A core contribution of PUCS is its reinterpretation of dimensionful physical constants (such as c, h, k, e, Na). Within the PUCS framework, the numerical values of these constants in any given Layer 3 unit system are understood not as mystical Layer 1 properties, but as the explicit numerical scaling factors required to convert a numerical value measured on one Layer 3 base unit scale (or combination thereof) to the equivalent numerical value on another, thereby quantifying the underlying Layer 1/2 proportionalities. The large or small numerical values of constants in systems like SI are simply the specific coordinate transformations needed within that particular Layer 3 system to translate between its arbitrarily chosen base unit scales and reveal the physics' inherent, unit-independent ratios. This analysis shows that the "natural" unit system where constants become 1 is not an imposed mathematical construct, but is implicitly defined and empirically encoded within the measured values of the primary constants in any valid Layer 3 system like SI. Consequently, PUCS clarifies that SI, while scaled for human convenience based on historical and macroscopic factors, functions as a complete and de facto natural unit system because it contains all the necessary information (in the measured values of its primary constants) to define a system where the fundamental proportionalities are numerically unity.

Furthermore, PUCS provides a principled criterion for distinguishing between different types of physical constants and their roles in defining measurement systems. By identifying constants that represent fundamental dimensional scaling (Primary Scaling Factors like c, h, k, e, Na) versus those that quantify interaction strengths or are derivative forms (Layer 4 concepts like G or ħ), PUCS offers a robust basis for determining which sets of constants can legitimately define the basis of a physically consistent Layer 3 unit system, revealing inconsistencies in approaches that mix roles or use derivative forms in their foundational definitions.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper has presented a four-layered model – Physical Reality (Layer 1), Human Perception and Categorization (Layer 2), Measurement Systems (Layer 3), and Physical Laws and Theories (Layer 4) – to describe the hierarchical construction of human scientific understanding of the physical universe. Our journey towards understanding Layer 1 is not a direct path, but a process mediated by our biological filters (Layer 2), formalized by our measurement conventions (Layer 3), and abstracted through our theoretical frameworks (Layer 4). Scientific knowledge, in this view, is a complex edifice built layer by layer, where each level shapes and is shaped by the others, but critically, is distinct from the underlying reality it seeks to describe.

A central source of confusion in physics arises from misinterpreting the role and nature of elements in the intermediate layers, particularly Layer 3. This layer, where we define arbitrary base units (like the kilogram or meter) to quantify the dimensions identified in Layer 2, and where primary dimensionful constants (like c, h, k, e) appear, is frequently misunderstood. We often mistakenly attribute the properties of Layer 3 (such as the specific numerical values of constants within a given unit system) to Layer 1 reality itself, rather than recognizing them as artifacts of our chosen Layer 3 measurement scales relative to inherent Layer 1/2 proportionalities. Similarly, Layer 4 derived concepts and units (like Energy and the Joule) are sometimes conflated with Layer 3 base measurements or even Layer 1 reality, obscuring their nature as theoretical constructs built upon Layer 2/3 foundations.

Understanding the distinct function of each layer, and especially clarifying the true role of Layer 3, is therefore critically important. Dimensionful constants are not mystical numbers from Layer 1; they are the necessary scaling factors within Layer 3 that bridge the arbitrary scales of our base units according to the fundamental proportionalities of the universe (rooted in Layer 1, filtered through Layer 2). Their specific numerical values are determined by the historical and conventional choices made when defining our base units in Layer 3.

Frameworks like the Physics Unit Coordinate System (PUCS) are essential tools for navigating this complexity. By rigorously analyzing the structure of Layer 3 measurement systems, PUCS reveals that the numerical values of constants in systems like SI are precisely the coordinate transformations required to align our arbitrary unit scales with the universe's inherent, unit-independent proportionalities. This demonstrates that SI, despite its anthropocentric scaling, functions as a complete and de facto natural unit system because the fundamental Layer 1/2 relationships are empirically encoded within the measured values of its constants.

Ultimately, by clarifying the function of measurement systems and constants within this layered structure, the PUCS framework helps us to more accurately interpret our scientific descriptions. It reveals that many of the perceived "mysteries" surrounding constants dissolve when their true nature as Layer 3 scaling artifacts is understood. This understanding redirects our focus towards the fundamental, unit-independent proportionalities of Layer 1/2, thereby revealing underlying simplicity and providing a clearer path for developing more unified and conceptually robust theories in Layer 4, theories that model the territory rather than merely describing the intricacies of our particular map.
