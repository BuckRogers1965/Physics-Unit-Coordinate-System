## Abstract

We propose a radical shift in how fundamental physical constants (e.g., the fine-structure constant α, elementary charge e, Planck constant h) are defined and distributed. Instead of enforcing a single, centralized value (e.g., CODATA’s periodic updates), we advocate for a versioned, Git-like repository of constants, where:

- Every measured value is preserved (including historical data).
- Users select which "branch" or "tag" to use (e.g., 2023/g-2 vs. 2018/CODATA).
- Derived constants auto-update when switching versions.

This system enables reproducible science, transparent uncertainty tracking, and user-defined precision standards.

## 1. The Problem with Current Metrology

### 1.1 Static Constants Are Obsolete

- CODATA updates constants every ~4 years, discarding older measurements.
- Forces global redefinition (e.g., 2019 SI overhaul).
- No way to compare competing experimental methods.

### 1.2 One-Size-Fits-All Doesn’t Work

- A quantum physicist may need 12-digit α from g-2 experiments.
- An engineer may prefer 6-digit α for circuit design.
- A historian may want Bohr’s 1913 value for replication.

### 1.3 Lost Knowledge

- Pre-2019 SI defined μ₀ ≡ 4π×10⁻⁷ (exact), but this hid α’s true precision.
- Older values (e.g., 1947 α) are not easily accessible.

---

## 2. The Versioned Constants System

### 2.1 Core Principles

**Git-Like Repository**

Every constant has:

- Branches (experimental methods: g-2, lattice-QCD, hydrogen-spectra).
- Tags (releases: CODATA-2018, SI-2019, BIPM-2023).
- Commits (individual measurements).

**Dynamic Derivation**

- Changing α updates all dependent constants (e, μ₀, etc.).

**User Choice**

Select constants by:

```python
from metrology import constants
constants.use("2023/g-2")       # Latest Penning trap α
constants.use("legacy/SI-1983") # Pre-quantum values
```

---

### 2.2 Example Repository Structure

```
/fundamental_constants  
├── /alpha  
│   ├── g-2/  
│   │   ├── 2023.json  (α = 0.0072973525693 ± 1.1e-11)  
│   │   └── 2021.json  (α = 0.0072973525691 ± 2.3e-11)  
│   └── hydrogen/  
│       ├── 2022.json  (α = 0.0072973525698 ± 9e-12)  
│       └── 1980.json  (α = 0.007297352568 ± 1.2e-9)  
└── /e  
    ├── derived/       # Auto-computed from α  
    └── measured/      # Direct experiments (Millikan, etc.)
```

---

### 2.3 Benefits

- **Reproducibility**: Pin constants like software dependencies.
- **Transparency**: Full history of how α changed over time.
- **Flexibility**: Choose precision levels per application.

---

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 The Reference Database

A public Git repo (e.g., GitHub) storing:

- Raw experimental data
- Uncertainty calculations
- Derivation graphs (e.g., how e depends on α)

---

### 3.2 The API

```python
import metrology

# Switch to 2023’s best α (g-2 measurement)  
metrology.use("alpha/2023/g-2")  

# Get derived elementary charge  
e = metrology.get("e")  # Computed from latest α  

# Compare with 2018 CODATA  
metrology.use("alpha/2018/CODATA")  
e_old = metrology.get("e")  

print(f"Δe = {e - e_old:.3e}")  # Difference due to α-update
```

---

### 3.3 Integration with Tools

- **Symbolic math**: SymPy plugins for versioned constants.
- **Lab equipment**: Firmware that pulls constants by tag.
- **Education**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks showing α’s evolution.

---

## 4. Challenges

### 4.1 Resistance from Standards Bodies

- CODATA/BIPM may oppose decentralizing "their" constants.
- **Solution**: Fork their data and prove utility via adoption.

### 4.2 Theoretical Consistency

- Does QED allow α to vary across versions?
- **Answer**: No—but measurements do. This system tracks empirical uncertainty, not theory.

### 4.3 Legacy Code

- Old software assumes fixed constants.
- **Solution**: A compatibility layer with "default" values.

---

## 5. Call to Action

We call for:

- A community-run constants repository (Git + CI/CD for validation).
- Adoption by major physics engines (SciPy, ROOT, Wolfram).
- New publication standards requiring constant-version citations.

---

## Conclusion

The era of static constants is over. Let’s build a system that:

- Preserves history  
- Empowers users  
- Makes metrology agile
