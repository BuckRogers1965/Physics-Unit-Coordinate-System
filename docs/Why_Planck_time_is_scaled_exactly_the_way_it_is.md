** Why Planck time is scaled exactly the way it is. 

We broke the escape velocity down to the natural units of mass in frequency and length (so they are scaled in units of time) where β = 1.

```
   sqrt(2 \cdot (t_P^2 \cdot m_n) / r_n) = β = 1.000000000000e+00 
```

The natural radius ($r_n$) is the length with SI defintion of the meter removed so it is based on time.
The natural mass ($m_n$) is the Compton frequency of the mass, it is based on inverse time.  

This is at the radius of a black hole but when we look at these values:

```
   r_n/(m_n*2) = 1.826241629811e-86 s^2
   t_P^2       = 1.826241629811e-86 s^2
```

Which means that at the radius of a black hole the non reduced Planck time squared is the proportion of natural radius / (natural mass * 2)

$$
t_P^2 = \frac{r_n}{(2 \cdot m_n)}
$$

So with the defintion of the second in SI, $t_P$ is scaled at this value to offset the proportions of these natural ratios of mass and radius.

When we scale time to the planck scale what happens is $t_P = 1$ and we scale the natural units of time to planck time. 

```
   m_Planck = (2 * Natural Mass * t_P)  = 7.404938101467e+38 dimensionless planck mass
   r_Planck = (Natural Radius / t_P)    = 7.404938101467e+38 dimensionless planck length
```   

This means that at the black escape velocity this is true:

$$
r_{Planck} = 2 \cdot  m_{Planck}
$$

And this is why the planck time scale has the values it does.  Planck time is not an interval itself, it is just a unit scaling of SI seconds to a unit of measurement definition of time so that these natural equivalences are true.  

This is what G was always doing in the formula all along, to interact with the SI unit scales of if the mass and length units to create this proportion at the planck unit of measurements defintion.  Planck units are not a different regime where the rules we know break down, it is simply a unit scaling of SI to a different defintion of time, mass, length, temperature, charge, frequency, all become aligned to each other in the natural proportions of the universe.  

G acts as unit scaling in the gravity formulas, scaling our SI units of measure to the natural proportions of the universe. This is the unit scaling that G performs in formulas.

$$
G_{SI} = \frac{t_P^2 \cdot  c^3}{Hz_{kg}}
$$

G has:
*  $meter^3$ unit scaling and that is $c^3$. 
*  1/kg unit scaling and that is $Hz_{kg}$, the m/f ratio in the defintion of $h = \frac{m}{f} \cdot c^2$
*  $t_P^2$ is the remaining time scale that is left in G if you remove the length and mass scaling.

The constants act as unit scaling in SI formulas. Constants encode these natural unit scales of time and G encodes the planck time scale.  And that is all they do.
