## How SI units encode natural unit scaling

Units like kilogram and meter are not fundamentalâ€”they serve as conversion factors that map natural, dimensionless physical quantities (expressed in natural units like Hz or seconds) into human-scale measurements. Physical constants such as $Hz_{kg}$, $c$, and $t_{Ph}$ act as scaling factors that translate between these natural units and SI units, making units essentially instructions for coordinate transformations between layers of measurement.

1. SI units are arbitrary human defined scales picked for human convenience
2. Physics depends on natural proportions between properties of particles.
3. SI units do not match these natural proportions alone.

QED: Constants harmonize the SI unit system to nature's proportions.

### Summary

When we express physical quantities like mass and length, the units (kg, meter, etc.) are not intrinsic properties but **conversion factors** that map natural, dimensionless physical values into familiar human-scale measurements.

* The **natural units** represent these quantities in fundamental, often frequency- or time-based forms (e.g., mass as Hz, length as seconds).
* The **SI units** scale these natural values by universal constants such as $Hz_{kg}$, the speed of light $c$, and Planck time $t_{Ph}$.
* The **Planck units** normalize these natural values further into dimensionless quantities by incorporating Planck-scale constants, providing a universal, unit-independent representation.

| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Mass**   | $M_{\rm SI}$ \[kg]                    | $m_n$ \[Hz]               | $m_P$ \[dimensionless]    |
|            | $M_{\rm SI} = m_n \times Hz_{kg}$     | $m_n = m_P / t_{Ph}$      | $m_P = m_n \times t_{Ph}$ |
|            | $= m_P \times \frac{Hz_{kg}}{t_{Ph}}$ |                           |                           |
| **Length** | $r_{\rm SI}$ \[m]                     | $r_n$ \[s]                | $r_P$ \[dimensionless]    |
|            | $r_{\rm SI} = r_n \times c$           | $r_n = r_P \times t_{Ph}$ | $r_P = r_n / t_{Ph}$      |
|            | $= r_P \times c \times t_{Ph}$        |                           |                           |

### Interpretation

* **SI units** instruct us how to convert from natural physical quantities to everyday measurable values.
* **Natural units** encode the fundamental physical essence using frequencies and times.
* **Planck units** strip away arbitrary human conventions, revealing dimensionless ratios that are universal and fundamental.

This framework demystifies physical constants by showing they serve as **scaling bridges** between human-scale measurements and natural, fundamental quantities.
