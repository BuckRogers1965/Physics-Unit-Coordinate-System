# Decoding Planck Units via Unit Scaling and  $G_n$

## Abstract

Standard formulas for Planck units appear as complex combinations of fundamental constants $\( \hbar \)$, \( c \), and \( G \). This document shows how, within the unit scaling framework, these complexities dissolve. By defining the "natural" gravitational constant \( $G\_n$ \), we demonstrate that the \( h \)-based Planck units (Length, Time, Mass, Temperature) emerge as simple expressions involving $\sqrt{G\_n}$ and the framework's core unit scaling factors \( c \), $\( \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \)$, and $\( \text{K}_\text{Hz} \)$. This reveals $\( G\_n \)$ as the fundamental scaling parameter for the Planck scale and clarifies the role of other constants as conversion bridges.

## 1. The Standard Gravitational Constant ($G_{SI}$)

The gravitational constant $G$ in SI units has a value and dimensions:

$$ G\_{SI} \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} $$

Its role in standard formulas often makes Planck units seem like arbitrary combinations of constants.

## 2. Introducing the Natural Gravitational Constant ($G_n$)

Within the unit scaling framework, $G\_{SI}$ is related to a more fundamental, "natural" gravitational constant $G\_n$. We define $G\_{SI}$ as $G\_n$ scaled by factors derived from other fundamental constants that relate SI units to natural units:

$$ G\_{SI} = G\_n \cdot \frac{c^3}{\text{Hz}\_\text{kg}} $$

Here:
- \( $G\_n$ \) is the natural gravitational coupling constant. Based on dimensional analysis making quantities like $\sqrt{G\_n m\_n / r\_n}$ dimensionless, $\( G\_n \)$ has fundamental dimensions of \( $[\text{Time}^2]$ \).
- \( c \) is the speed of light, the scaling factor bridging natural Length and Time units (and SI m and s).
- $\( \text{Hz}_\text{kg} = h/c^2 \)$ is the scaling factor bridging SI Mass (kg) and natural Frequency/Mass/Energy units (Hz equivalent).

This definition means $\( G\_n = G\_{SI} \cdot \frac{\text{Hz}\_\text{kg}}{c^3} \)$. Calculating its value using SI constants gives $\( G\_n \approx 2.903 \times 10^{-87} \, \text{s}^2 \)$.

## 3. Other Core Unit Scaling Factors

We also use the following scaling factors from the framework:
- $\( c \approx 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (Length \( \leftrightarrow \) Time scaling)$
- $\( \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} = h/c^2 \approx 7.372 \times 10^{-51} \, \text{kg/Hz} \) (Mass \( \leftrightarrow \) Frequency scaling)$
- $\( \text{K}\_\text{Hz} = k\_B/h \approx 2.084 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Hz/K} \) (Temperature \( \leftrightarrow \) Frequency scaling)$

\( $\text{Hz}\_\text{kg}$ \) represents the ratio $\( m/f \)$ in the relationship $\( h = (m/f) \cdot c^2 \)$.
$\( \text{K}\_\text{Hz} \)$ represents the ratio of temperature scaling to Hertz.

## 4. Deriving the h-Based Planck Units

Using the natural constant $\( G\_n \)$ and the scaling factors \( c \), $\( \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \)$, and $\( \text{K}\_\text{Hz} \)$, the \( h \)-based Planck units simplify significantly:

- **Planck Time $\($t\_P^h$\)$:** The fundamental time scale set by gravity.
  
$$ t_P^h = \sqrt{G\_n} $$

- **Planck Length ($l\_P^h$):** The time scale converted to length using \( c \).
  
$$ l_P^h = \sqrt{G\_n} \cdot c $$

- **Planck Mass ($m\_P^h$):** The inverse time scale converted to mass using $\( \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \)$.
  
$$ m\_P^h = \frac{\text{Hz}\_\text{kg}}{ \sqrt{G\_n} } $$

- **Planck Temperature ($T\_P^h$):** The inverse time scale converted to temperature using $\( \text{K}\_\text{Hz} \)$.
  
$$ T\_P^h = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{G\_n} \cdot \text{K}\_\text{Hz} } $$

These simple formulas define the \( h \)-based Planck units using $\( G\_n \)$ and the primary unit scaling factors.

## 5. Key Insights

- **$\( G\_n \)$ is the Primary Scale:** The natural gravitational constant $\( G\_n \)$ is the fundamental unit of squared time $\( (T\_n)^2 \)$ from which the Planck scale naturally emerges. Its square root $\( \sqrt{G\_n} \)$ sets the base unit of time at the Planck scale in this framework.
- **Constants as Multipliers:** \( c \), $\( \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \)$, and $\( \text{K}\_\text{Hz} \)$ are the necessary scaling factors to convert the base time scale $\sqrt{G\_n}$ into corresponding scales of length, mass, and temperature within our chosen (SI) unit system.
- **Simplicity Revealed:** The standard Planck unit formulas appear complex because they mix $\( G\_{SI} \)$ (a composite scalar) with $\( \hbar \)$ (a composite scalar) and \( c \). By using $\( G\_n \)$ (a base scalar) and the other scaling factors, the structure becomes simple.
- **Dimensional Consistency:** The derivations ensure that the units cancel perfectly within the framework's definitions, resulting in the expected SI units for each Planck quantity.

## 6. Conclusion

The unit scaling framework, by defining a natural gravitational constant $\( G\_n \)$ with dimensions of $\( [\text{Time}^2] \)$, simplifies the derivation and interpretation of Planck units. The \( h \)-based Planck length, time, mass, and temperature are revealed as direct products of $\sqrt{G\_n}$ (the fundamental time scale) and the core unit scaling factors \( c \), $\( \text{Hz}\_\text{kg} \)$, and $\( \text{K}\_\text{Hz} \)$. This demonstrates that the Planck scale is fundamentally set by $\( G\_n \)$, and the other constants merely act as conversion factors to express this scale across different dimensions (Length, Mass, Temperature) within our arbitrary SI unit system. This perspective demystifies Planck units and reinforces the framework's view of fundamental constants as the essential bridges between our units and the universe's inherent proportionalities.

## Additional Insights

### Time as the Fundamental Scaling Axis

In this framework, **time** emerges as the core axis from which all other physical dimensions are derived. The natural gravitational constant $\( G_n \)$, with dimensions of $\( [\text{Time}^2] \)$, establishes the foundational unit of duration at the Planck scale. From this root, all other units are extended through conversion factors:

- **Length** scales from time via the speed of light \( c \):  
  $\( \text{Length} = \text{Time} \cdot c \)$
- **Mass** and **energy** scale inversely with time via $\( \text{Hz}_\text{kg} \)$:  
  $\( \text{Mass} = \frac{1}{\text{Time}} \cdot \text{Hz}_\text{kg} \)$
- **Temperature** also scales inversely with time, but via $\( \text{K}_\text{Hz} \)$:  
  $\( \text{Temperature} = \frac{1}{\text{Time}} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{K}_\text{Hz}} \)$

This structure unifies all Planck units as **time-scaled expressions**, reinforcing the idea that time is the primary dimensional seed in this naturalized unit system.

### The Illusion of Dimensional Complexity

Traditional Planck units obscure this simplicity by combining multiple dimensional constants (e.g., $\( \hbar \)$, \( c \), and \( G \)) in a tangled way. These constants are not independently fundamental, but rather encode unit relationships. Once these relationships are modularized as scaling ratios (e.g., $\( h = \text{Hz}_\text{kg} \cdot c^2 \)$), the formulas collapse to elegant expressions rooted in $\( \sqrt{G_n} \)$.

### Toward a Modular Interpretation of Nature

This insight supports a **modular** rather than monolithic view of physics, where constants like \( h \), \( c \), and \( $k_B$ \) are not mysterious absolutes but **scaling bridges**â€”tools for translating between dimensions anchored in time. Under this lens, Planck units are no longer curiosities or endpoints, but simply **coordinates in a time-centric unit space** governed by the geometry of natural dimensional conversion.
