## Explaining Fundamental Constant Relationships via Unit Scaling

Certain algebraic equalities involving fundamental constants and Planck units, such as hc = G m\_P^2 and the simplification of G m\_P^2 / c^2, have been mathematically known for decades but lacked a clear physical explanation for *why* these specific combinations result in such clean relationships. This presented a lingering "mystery".

The Physics Unit Coordinate System (PUCS) framework resolves this by viewing dimensionful constants not as irreducible numbers, but as composite Layer 3 scaling factors and fundamental scales necessary to quantify Layer 1/2 proportionalities relative to arbitrary Layer 3 unit choices. The "mystery" dissolves because these relationships arise from the algebraic cancellation of those scaling factors, revealing simpler underlying connections.

G encodes the non reduced Planck time defined using h, not $\hbar$. Don't complain to me, that is how G works in Physics, we are the ones that added $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ to simple unit scaling.  

We use the following relationships from the PUCS framework:
- h       = Hz\_kg * c^2
- G       = t\_P^2 * c^3 / Hz\_kg
- m\_P     = Hz\_kg / t\_P
(Where t\_P = sqrt(hG/c^5) is the Planck Time scale using h)

### Demonstration 1: Why hc = G m\_P^2

This equality is known from the definition of Planck mass. PUCS shows it's a result of the cancellation of Layer 3 scaling components.

Substitute Layer 3 components into hc = G m\_P^2:

'''
LHS: hc = (Hz\_kg * c^2) * c
       = Hz\_kg * c^3

RHS: G * m_P^2 = (t\_P^2 * c^3 / Hz\_kg) * (Hz\_kg / t\_P)^2
               = (t\_P^2 * c^3 / Hz\_kg) * (Hz\_kg^2 / t\_P^2)
               = (t\_P^2 * c^3 * Hz\_kg^2) / (Hz\_kg * t\_P^2)
               = c^3 * Hz\_kg

Result: LHS = RHS
        Hz_kg * c^3 = Hz_kg * c^3
'''

The terms representing the fundamental Time scale (t\_P^2) and the Mass-Frequency scaling component (Hz\_kg) cancel out. The identity holds because the composite structure of h, c, G, and m\_P, when viewed through their Layer 3 components, algebraically forces this equality.

### Demonstration 2: Why G m\_P^2 / c^2 Simplifies to h/c

It's been noted that this combination equals h/c (related to photon momentum), but the reason for this specific value was unclear. PUCS shows this is another instance of Layer 3 scaling factors canceling.

Substitute Layer 3 components into G m\_P^2 / c^2:

'''
G * m\_P^2 / c^2 = ( (t\_P^2 * c^3 / Hz\_kg) * (Hz\_kg / t\_P)^2 ) / c^2
                = ( (t\_P^2 * c^3 / Hz\_kg) * (Hz\_kg^2 / t\_P^2) ) / c^2
                = ( (t\_P^2 * c^3 * Hz\_kg^2) / (Hz\_kg * t_P^2) ) / c^2
                = (c^3 * Hz\_kg) / c^2
                = c * Hz\_kg

Using h = Hz\_kg * c^2 => Hz\_kg = h / c^2:

c * Hz\_kg = c * (h / c^2)
          = h / c
'''

The cancellation of t\_P and Hz\_kg terms reveals that this combination of gravitational and Planck scales is equivalent to a combination of quantum action and relativistic scales (h/c). This isn't a coincidence between different forces, but a demonstration of how the Layer 3 scaling factors, when combined appropriately, remove the arbitrary unit scaling baggage and leave a relationship involving more fundamental scaling factors (c, Hz\_kg, or h, c) that reflects a basic physical property (momentum).

These demonstrations, enabled by viewing constants as composite unit scaling factors, resolve the "why" behind these known relationships, showing them to be consequences of the structure of our measurement system rather than unexplained fundamental numerical coincidences.
