# Applying the Definition of \( $G_N$ \) to the Einstein Field Equations

## Introduction

In this section, we will explore how redefining the gravitational constant \( G \) in terms of natural units impacts the Einstein field equations. By using the definition \( $G = G_n \cdot \frac{c^3}{\text{Hz}_\text{kg}}$ \), we will see how this transforms the tensor formulation of gravity.

### Standard Einstein Field Equation (SI Units)

The Einstein field equations in standard General Relativity (using SI units) are given by:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
$$

Where:
- \( $G_{\mu\nu}$ \) is the Einstein tensor.
- \( $\Lambda$ \) is the cosmological constant.
- \( $g_{\mu\nu}$ \) is the metric tensor.
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
- \( c \) is the speed of light.
- \( $T_{\mu\nu}$ \) is the stress-energy tensor.

### Applying the Definition of \( G \)

Now, letâ€™s apply the redefined \( G \) in terms of natural units:

$$ G = G_n \cdot \frac{c^3}{\text{Hz}_\text{kg}} $$

Substituting this definition into the Einstein field equations, we get:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G_n \cdot c^3}{\text{Hz}_\text{kg} \cdot c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
$$

Simplifying the right-hand side:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G_n}{\text{Hz}_\text{kg} \cdot c} T_{\mu\nu}
$$

### What This Means

In this new formulation:
- \( $G_n$ \) is now the "natural" gravitational constant.
- The factors of \( c \) and \( \text{Hz}_\text{kg} \) act to scale the tensor values to the natural units of mass and length.
- The result is that the Einstein tensor and the stress-energy tensor are scaled by these conversion factors, simplifying the interpretation of the equation in natural units.

### Key Insight

This approach shows that the gravitational constant \( G \) is an not independent fundamental constant in a unit scaling sense, like c, h, k, or e are, but rather a scaled fundamental proportion of reality that emerges from the natural units structure. This allows for a more unified view of the constants and helps clarify how they fit together in the framework of general relativity.

By reinterpreting the Einstein field equations in terms of these scaled constants, we move away from the idea that \( G \) is an isolated mystery and instead view it as a result of unit scaling.
