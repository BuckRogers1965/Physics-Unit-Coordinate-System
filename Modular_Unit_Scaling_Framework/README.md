# Modular Unit Scaling Framework

This framework simplifies complex physics formulas by modularly rescaling units across temperature, frequency, mass, and energy. Using natural unit scaling, it reveals the underlying simplicity of these formulas, bridging traditional SI units and natural units seamlessly.

To use the framework put the framework file `Modular_Unit_Scaling.py` in the directory and use this in your program:

`from Modular_Unit_Scaling import c,h,k,kg_J,J_kg,Hz_kg,kg_Hz,K_Hz,Hz_K,Hz_J,J_Hz,K_J,J_K,K_kg,kg_K`

I have cleaned up and reordered the formulas that are generated by the formula simplification program using this modular framework.

Since `kg_J = c^2, h = Hz_kg * kg_J, and k = K_Hz Hz_kg kg_J` we can simplify any formula where `c^2, h, and k` appear to just demonstrate the simple unit scaling that these constants are doing explicity to clarify and simplify the physics.

The file named `Simplified_Constant_Formulas.py` demonstrates how to automate the simplification of formulas in this framework.  This allows us simplify and reduce complexity in formulas are doing to help with learning and to make the math read almost like a story.

## Key Formula Simplifications

### Thermal de Broglie Wavelength
**Original:**    `λ_th = h / (sqrt(T) * sqrt(m) * sqrt(2 * pi * k))`

**Simplified:**  `λ_th = c / (sqrt(2 * pi * f_T * f_m))`

Where:  
- `f_m = m * kg_Hz`  
- `f_T = T * K_Hz`

This formula becomes a simple geometric mean of two frequencies (`f_T` and `f_m`) scaled by `2 * pi` and converted into a wavelength by `c`.

### Stephan-Boltzmann Formula
**Original:**    `σ = 2 * pi**5 * k**4 / (15 * c**2 * h**3)`

**Simplified:**  `σ = K_Hz**4 * Hz_kg * 2 * pi**5 / 15`

This is arguably one of the most complex formulas in thermodynamics. Simplified, it shows that `T**4` is converted into frequency by `K_Hz**4`, and one of these frequencies is then converted into a mass, scaled by constants.

---

### Planck's Law Formula
**Original:**    `B(f, T) = 2 * f**3 * h / (c**2 * (e**(f * h / (T * k)) - 1))`

**Simplified:**  `B(f, T) = 2 * f**3 * Hz_kg / (e**(f / (T * K_Hz)) - 1)`

In the numerator, one of the frequencies is converted into a mass. In the exponent, it becomes either a ratio of frequencies or can be interpreted as a ratio of temperatures: `f * Hz_K / T`.

---

### Wien's Displacement Constant
**Original:**    `x_peak = c * h / (T * k * λ_max)`

**Simplified:**  `x_peak = c / (K_Hz * T * λ_max)`

This formula simply converts temperature into frequency, scaled by `λ_max` and unit-converted to a wavelength by `c`.

---

### Debye Temperature
**Original:**    `Θ_D = h * ν_D / k`

**Simplified:**  `Θ_D = ν_D * Hz_K`

This becomes a simple unit conversion of frequency to temperature.

---

### Einstein Temperature
**Original:**    `Θ_E = h * ν_E / k`

**Simplified:**  `Θ_E = ν_E * Hz_K`

Like the Debye temperature, this simply converts frequency to temperature.

## About the Modular Framework

### Concept
The Modular Unit Scaling Framework redefines complex physics formulas using unit scaling factors. Constants like `c`, `h`, and `k` are no longer standalone values but scaling factors for converting between dimensions, such as:
- Frequency (`f`)
- Mass (`m`)
- Temperature (`T`)
- Energy (`E`)

By unifying these relationships, the framework bridges SI units and natural units.

### Key Features
1. **Universal Simplifications**:  
   Any formula can be modularly rescaled and simplified using pre-defined unit scaling factors.

2. **Seamless Conversions**:  
   Supports transitions between SI, natural, and even imperial units with factors like:
   - `kg_lbm = 2.20462`  
   - `ft_m = 0.3048`  
   - `R_K = 9 / 5`

3. **Cross-Dimensional Insight**:  
   Reveals the equivalence of temperature, frequency, mass, and energy:  
   `T <- K_Hz -> f <- Hz_kg -> m <- kg_J -> E`

### Applications
- **Thermodynamics**: Simplifies core formulas like Planck’s law and Stephan-Boltzmann’s formula.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Clarifies relationships between frequency, mass, and energy.
- **Education**: Makes advanced physics concepts more intuitive.

### Future Expansion
- Integration with additional unit systems (e.g., astrophysical or atomic).
- Python APIs to input formulas dynamically and output simplified versions.
- Visualization tools to map relationships between dimensions and units.

This framework not only simplifies calculations but also redefines how constants and units are perceived in physics, making them more intuitive and interconnected.

   How constants c, h, and k act as unit scaling factors.


   E=mc^2   E=m kg_J where kg_J = c^2 with units of J/kg
   kg_J  = 8.98755178737e+16 J/kg      J_kg = 1.11265005605e-17 kg/J
   This unit scaling exists because there are 299792458.0 meters in each light second.

   E=hf    h = Hz_kg kg_J  therefore Hz_kg = h/kg_J
   Hz_J  = 6.62607015e-34 J/Hz         J_Hz = 1.50919017964e+33 Hz/J
   Hz_kg = 7.37249732381e-51 kg/Hz     kg_Hz = 1.35639248965e+50 Hz/kg
   Hz_kg exists because there are 7.372497323812708e-51 kg in each Hz.

   E=kT    k = K_Hz Hz_kg kg_J therefore K_Hz = k/(Hz_kg kg_J)
   K_J   = 1.380649e-23 J/K            J_K = 7.24297051604e+22 K/J
   K_Hz  = 2.083661912333e+10 Hz/K     Hz_K = 4.79924307337e-11 K/Hz
   K_Hz exists because there are 20836619123.327576 Hz in each Kelvin.

        In SI units: 4.79924307337e-11 K = 1 Hz = 7.37249732381e-51 kg = 6.62607015e-34 J
   In natural units:        1 K          = 1 Hz =         1 kg         =         1 J

   The constants (c, h, k) have the values they do because SI units are defined far
   from natural units, where these scaling factors would be unity.
   In natural units (where 1 Hz = 1 kg = 1 K = 1 J), these scaling factors (kg_J, Hz_J, K_J) would all be 1.
   It is only by rescaling our units of measure to unity with each other that c=h=k=1 is true.
   This shows that c, h, and k's SI values are solely unit conversion artifacts,
   not indicators of mysterious 'quantum magic' or deeply fundamental values beyond unit scaling.
   This does not diminish the constants, understanding their true nature makes them more important.

   T ~ f ~ m ~ J are all equivalences.

   T <-- K_Hz --> Hz <-- Hz_kg --> kg <-- kg_J --> J
   Since the units are equivalent you can simply scale between any unit
   No one unit of measure is more important than any other.
