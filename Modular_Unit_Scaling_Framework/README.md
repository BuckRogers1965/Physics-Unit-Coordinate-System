# Modular Unit Scaling Framework

This framework simplifies complex physics formulas by modularly rescaling units across temperature, frequency, mass, and energy. Using natural unit scaling, it reveals the underlying simplicity of these formulas, bridging traditional SI units and natural units seamlessly.

I have cleaned up and reordered the formulas that are generated by the formula simplification program using this modular framework.

Since kg_J = c^2, h = Hz_kg * kg_J, and k = K_Hz Hz_kg kg_J we can simplify and formula where they both appear to just demonstrate the simple unit scaling that these constants are doing explicity to clarify and simplify the physics.

This simplfication of the formulas allows us to tell simple stories of what the formulas are doing to help with learning and to make the math read almost like a story.

## Key Formula Simplifications

### Thermal de Broglie Wavelength
**Original:**  
`λ_th = h / (sqrt(T) * sqrt(m) * sqrt(2 * pi * k))`

**Simplified:**  
`λ_th = c / (sqrt(2 * pi * f_T * f_m))`

Where:  
- `f_m = m * kg_Hz`  
- `f_T = T * K_Hz`

This formula becomes a simple geometric mean of two frequencies (`f_T` and `f_m`) scaled by `2 * pi` and converted into a wavelength by `c`.

### Stephan-Boltzmann Formula
**Original:**  
`σ = 2 * pi**5 * k**4 / (15 * c**2 * h**3)`

**Simplified:**  
`σ = K_Hz**4 * Hz_kg * 2 * pi**5 / 15`

This is arguably one of the most complex formulas in thermodynamics. Simplified, it shows that `T**4` is converted into frequency by `K_Hz**4`, and one of these frequencies is then converted into a mass, scaled by constants.

### Planck's Law Formula
**Original:**  
`B(f, T) = 2 * f**3 * h / (c**2 * (e**(f * h / (T * k)) - 1))`

**Simplified:**  
`B(f, T) = 2 * f**3 * Hz_kg / (e**(f / (T * K_Hz)) - 1)`

In the numerator, one of the frequencies is converted into a mass. In the exponent, it becomes either a ratio of frequencies or can be interpreted as a ratio of temperatures: `f * Hz_K / T`.

### Wien's Displacement Constant
**Original:**  
`x_peak = c * h / (T * k * λ_max)`

**Simplified:**  
`x_peak = c / (K_Hz * T * λ_max)`

This formula simply converts temperature into frequency, scaled by `λ_max` and unit-converted to a wavelength by `c`.

---

### Debye Temperature
**Original:**  
`Θ_D = h * ν_D / k`

**Simplified:**  
`Θ_D = ν_D * Hz_K`

This becomes a simple unit conversion of frequency to temperature.

---

### Einstein Temperature
**Original:** 
`Θ_E = h * ν_E / k`

**Simplified:**  
`Θ_E = ν_E * Hz_K`

Like the Debye temperature, this simply converts frequency to temperature.

## About the Modular Framework

### Concept
The Modular Unit Scaling Framework redefines complex physics formulas using unit scaling factors. Constants like `c`, `h`, and `k` are no longer standalone values but scaling factors for converting between dimensions, such as:
- Frequency (`f`)
- Mass (`m`)
- Temperature (`T`)
- Energy (`E`)

By unifying these relationships, the framework bridges SI units and natural units.

### Key Features
1. **Universal Simplifications**:  
   Any formula can be modularly rescaled and simplified using pre-defined unit scaling factors.

2. **Seamless Conversions**:  
   Supports transitions between SI, natural, and even imperial units with factors like:
   - `kg_lbm = 2.20462`  
   - `ft_m = 0.3048`  
   - `R_K = 9 / 5`

3. **Cross-Dimensional Insight**:  
   Reveals the equivalence of temperature, frequency, mass, and energy:  
   `T <- K_Hz -> f <- Hz_kg -> m <- kg_J -> E`

### Applications
- **Thermodynamics**: Simplifies core formulas like Planck’s law and Stephan-Boltzmann’s formula.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Clarifies relationships between frequency, mass, and energy.
- **Education**: Makes advanced physics concepts more intuitive.

### Future Expansion
- Integration with additional unit systems (e.g., astrophysical or atomic).
- Python APIs to input formulas dynamically and output simplified versions.
- Visualization tools to map relationships between dimensions and units.

This framework not only simplifies calculations but also redefines how constants and units are perceived in physics, making them more intuitive and interconnected.
