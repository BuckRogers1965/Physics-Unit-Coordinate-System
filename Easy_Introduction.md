# Why Constants Aren’t Mysterious (Even If They Seem That Way)

Once you see it, the idea seems obvious. Constants like `ℎ`, `𝑘`, and `𝑐` aren’t laws of nature—they’re just unit conversions. But for most people, this isn’t just counterintuitive—it feels wrong. Why? Because we’ve been taught for generations that these numbers are fundamental truths, not just human accounting tricks.

Let me try to bridge that gap.

## The "Aha!" Moment

Imagine you grew up thinking:

*   "The number `2.54` is a fundamental constant of space!"
*   "Distance itself is quantized in `inches`, and `2.54` is the sacred conversion factor to `centimeters`!"

That would sound ridiculous, right? Because `inches` and `centimeters` are just two ways of measuring the same thing. There’s no "law of nature" hiding in the number `2.54`—it’s just how the units relate.

Now apply that to physics:

*   `Planck’s constant` (`ℎ`) = The "`2.54`" between `joules` (energy) and `hertz` (frequency).
*   `Boltzmann’s constant` (`𝑘`) = The "`2.54`" between `kelvin` (temperature) and `hertz` (frequency).
*   `Speed of light` (`𝑐`) = The "`2.54`" between `meters` (length) and `seconds` (time).

That’s it. No magic, no quantum mystery—just unit conversions. Because `temperature`, `frequency`, `mass`, and `energy` are just different measurements of the same underlying thing.

## Why This Is Hard for People to Accept

We’re Taught to Worship Constants

*   Textbooks call `ℎ` and `𝑘` "**fundamental**," making them seem like cosmic rules.
*   But they’re not. They’re byproducts of how we defined `kilograms`, `meters`, and `seconds`.

Units Feel Real (Even When They’re Not)

*   We experience `temperature` as "`hot/cold`," not as `atomic vibration speed`.
*   We feel `mass` as "`heaviness`," not as `frequency`.
*   So when physics says "**Actually, they’re the same thing**," it clashes with intuition.

Physics Loves Complicated Stories

*   "`Quantum energy jumps`" sound profound.
*   "`We measured vibrations in joules instead of hertz`" sounds boring.
*   Guess which one gets taught in schools?

## The PUCS Perspective (Simplified)

This framework says:

*   Scale every unit of measure in the same scale.
*   Express everything in terms of it:
    *   **Mass** = **Energy**
    *   **Temperature** = **Frequency**
    *   **Frequency** = **Mass**
*   Now all "constants" disappear—because they were just unit bridges, just like if we scaled the `inch` to be the same scale as `cm`. No conversion factor needed if `inch` and `cm` is the same size.

## How to Explain This to Someone Else

Ask them: "Is `2.54 cm/inch` a law of nature, or just a conversion?"

Then say: "`Planck’s constant` is the same thing—just for `energy` ↔ `frequency`."

Watch their face.

Most people get stuck because they’ve never questioned why we have so many units. But once they see it, it’s like realizing money is just paper—the value was always in the stuff, not the numbers we assigned.

## Final Thought

The reason this seems trivial once you finally see it is that you’ve had the **ah-ha moment**:

*   **Constants** are **accounting tools**, not **physics**.
*   The universe doesn’t care about `joules` or `kelvin`.
*   All that matters is the underlying thing (that everything is equivalent to) and how it behaves.

For everyone else? It’s like telling them Santa isn’t real—it takes a minute to sink in.
