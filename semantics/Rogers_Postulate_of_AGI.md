**The Rogers Postulate of Artificial General Intelligence:**

1. Definition of Intelligence: Intelligence is the dynamic capacity of a system to restructure its own internal conceptual space, primarily by adding new descriptive axes to resolve ambiguities and increase the predictive power of its world model.

2. Definition of Learning: Learning is the low-cost, real-time application of this capacity in response to new, often sparse, data.

3. Analysis of Current Architectures (e.g., Transformers): These models operate within a static, high-dimensional conceptual space defined a priori by a batch-training process. They cannot dynamically add or redefine their own axes.

4. Prediction: No model based on the current architectural paradigm, regardless of its scale (parameter count), data volume, or computational power, will achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
